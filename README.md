# Dewald's Rails templates

Use these [Rails Templates](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html)
to generate new Rails 7 apps.

I make these for my own use and thus add here from time to time. New ones to the top of this README.

## The esbuild edition

| Created | 2 March 2024 ||
| -- | -- | -- |

I created this one for a project where I needed to import and use Javascript libraries that contain both JS and CSS. In that case Propshaft with Importmaps is often a challenge so I use Sprockets instead. Bundling with esbuild, so jsbundling-rails and cssbundling-rails.

### System requirements
This was developed, and only tested on, macOS.
- Node version higher than 18 installed on your computer
- Ruby version 3.2.2 (at the time of creating this 3.3.0 is out but does not work with this template)
- Postgres already installed on localhost and running

### Highlights
- esbuild (jsbundling-rails and cssbundling-rails)
- Tailwind for CSS (updated to use @import instead of @tailwind) with *forms* and *typography* plugins added
- Sprockets for asset pipeline
- SolidQueue is set up to run in the Puma process in Production so no separate server needed for background jobs. You might grow out of this eventually for performance reasons. In Development in runs as separate process.
- Mission Control is available to monitor SolidQueue at /jobs for authenticated users. You can restrict that further in MissionController if you have different classes of users (for example admins). 
- You can use `<% html_class "your fancy styles here" %>` and `<% body_class "probably tailwind classes here" %>` in any `.html.erb` file to add classes to the html and body elements for styling.

_Other details_
- PostgreSQL database in Development and Production
- Adds gem: [Simple form (without Bootstrap)](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form)
- Adds gem: dotenv-rails
- Creates alert messages/flashes and styles them (separately for desktop and mobile) plus create and connect a Stimulus controller to handle a click on the close button.
- Splits seed file for Development, Production, and Test environments. [Read more about it here.](https://blog.dewaldreynecke.net/entries/rails-seed-by-enviroment)

### Already done
- Database created and migrated
- Devise views copied to app so you can modify them
- git is initialised
- .gitignore updated to take care of .DS_Store and .env files
- Pages controller updated, with home page set as root in routes.rb

### To do afterwards
- Configure Action Mailer to be able to deliver Devise emails
- Add git remote and push
- If you are using VScode be sure to add the [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension

### Commands

```bash
rails new \
  -d postgresql \
  --javascript esbuild \
  --css tailwind \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dewaldreynecke/rails-templates/main/esbuild.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```
Run your local development server with
```bin/dev```

## Webpack with authentication

Same as _Mininal with authentication_ but adds Webpack to handle bundling.
This is not ideal in 2023, but it works. **I advise you to not use it.**

```bash
rails new \
  -d postgresql \
  -j webpack \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dewaldreynecke/rails-templates/main/auth.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```
Run your local development server with
```bin/dev```
to take care of both the rails server and webpack.

## Minimal with authentication

A minimum Rails app with Devise for user authentication that sets up the following:
- PostgreSQL database in Development and Production
- Adds gem: [Simple form (without Bootstrap)](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form)
- Adds gem: [Autoprefixer Rails](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails)
- Adds gem: dotenv-rails
- Enables gem: sassc-rails
- Creates alert messages for Devise notices and alerts (see to do below)
- Splits seed file for Development, Production, and Test environments. [Read more about it here.](https://blog.dewaldreynecke.net/entries/rails-seed-by-enviroment)

```bash
rails new \
  -d postgresql \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dewaldreynecke/rails-templates/main/auth.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```

**Already done**
- Database created and migrated
- Devise views copied to app so you can modify them
- git is initialised
- .gitignore updated to take care of .DS_Store and .env files
- Pages controller updated, with home page set as root in routes.rb

**To do afterwards**
- Configure Action Mailer production url in /config/environments/production.rb on line 4
- Add git remote and push
- Style your alert messages in app/views/shared/_flashes.html.erb
- Asset pipeline... Rails is a bit in flux now so I cannot make a choice or recommendation for you. This template just does the Rails 7 defaults (so no Webpacker). You'll have to implement whatever makes sense for your project. If you're going to stick to vanilla CSS and Javascript all in the 'Application' files then you need to do nothing extra. Maybe a good start for a small app? [This may help.](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/guide-to-rails-7-and-the-asset-pipeline/80851)
